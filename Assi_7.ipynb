    "ABSTRACTION :- Abstraction focuses on presenting the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding the complex implementation details. It allows us to work with high-level concepts and models rather than dealing with low-level details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.\n",

    "consider a Vehicle class hierarchy that includes subclasses like Car, Motorcycle, and Truck. Each vehicle has common attributes like speed and fuel_capacity, as well as methods like start(), accelerate(), and stop(). To abstract the concept of a vehicle, you could create an abstract base class called Vehicle with the common attributes and abstract methods like start() and accelerate(). The subclasses would then inherit from the Vehicle class and provide their own implementations of the abstract methods. This abstraction allows users to interact with any vehicle object using a common interface, regardless of the specific type of vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation : Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling related data and methods into a single unit, called a class. It ensures that the internal state and implementation details of an object are hidden and can only be accessed through a well-defined interface. Encapsulation helps in data hiding, information security, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a BankAccount class that represents a bank account object. It may have attributes like account_number, balance, and owner_name, as well as methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and get_balance(). Encapsulation can be achieved by making the attributes private (e.g., _account_number, _balance, _owner_name) and providing public methods (e.g., deposit(), withdraw(), get_balance()) to interact with and manipulate the internal data. This encapsulation protects the internal state of the bank account, preventing direct access to the attributes and enforcing controlled interactions through the defined methods."
